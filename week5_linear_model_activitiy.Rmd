### Understanding us birth rates

Using fivethirtyeight data set US_births_2000_2014. Provide the code to answer each question and knit to html markdown.   

#### To what extent is the annual birth rate decreasing or increating? 

#### What is the how many births you expect in 2018 ? (use linear models)

#### what day of the week has the most births on average ? 

#### what month has the most biths on average ? 

#### what month/weekday has the most births on average ?

#### When conisdering a model build on the interaction of month/weekday, which date is the the biggest outliers ? 

#### generate a line plot of births vs date

#### generate a barplot of sum of births by month



example plot

```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(ggplot2)

d = US_births_2000_2014
g = ggplot(d, aes(as.factor(year))) + geom_bar(aes(weight=births)) +
  coord_flip()
g


fit<-lm(births~year + as.factor(month):day_of_week, d)

x = summary(fit)$coefficients
x = x[x[,3] < .05,]
x = x[order(x[,1]),]


```
