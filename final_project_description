###### Deliverable 1: Predictive Model R markdown document including:
  
  htlm document generated with R mark down. Due Thursday April 5th
  + AUC Curve Plot for training and test set generated with ggplot2
  + feature importance bar plots generated with ggplot2
  + Text description of the tenique used in final model
  + Classification confusion matrix
  + Evidence that two other models were tried and the final model had the best preformance.
  + plot providing evidence that the optimim parameters were choosen for the model
  Delevery method is an html or pdf file uploaded to oaks, as well as a screen shot showing a ranking score of an uploaded model on kaggle. 
  
###### Deliverable 2: Web Application Dashboard published on Tableau public. Due Thursday April 12th

  + Build on raw data and predictions
  + dashboard bar plot filterable by device and os ranking highest risk to the top.
  + one additional dashboard, something that could be used operationally to find and describe fraud.

    * complexity of the build
    * Astetics and creativity of the data presentation 
  Dashboard delivery is to upload a working hyperlynk to the final dashboard published on tableau public.
