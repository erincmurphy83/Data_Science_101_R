###### Keys for Success in Data Science
  
  * Knowledge of Mathematics Modelings
  * Ability to Program to deliver solutions well adopted languages (R/Python)
  * Knowledge of manipulated databases and data structures
  * Domain Knowledge of the Subject
  
###### Core Concepts in Data Science
Types of Models

Supervised:  labels are known
  
  * Regression: predict a continuous variable, IE: predict commute time to work
  * Classification: predict a category, IE: predict whether a bank will default yes or no
  
Unsupervised = labels are unknown, and natural patterns are used to determine labels

  * Clustering: find natural groupings of customers
    + Mercerize with class number of years, programming vs number of years in college
  * Association Learning: finds associated frequencies of categories, IE Netflix movie recommend

##### Homework

Due Next Week's class, grading is pass if completed, else fail.
* Download and the software listed in the README (ie course Sylabus)
* Create a decision tree model to using the built in Iris data set in the data folder to predict iris types.
* upload to oaks a screen shot of the classifier output with the confusion matrix with a hand written text description of how the model works.  (Ensure the model is small enought to actually describe)
