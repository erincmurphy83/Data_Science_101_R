https://www.slideshare.net/Tommy96/crispdm-an-introduction

* CRISP DM Activity

###### Keys for Success in Data Science
  
  * Knowledge of Mathematics Modelings
  * Ability to Program to deliver solutions well adopted languages (R/Python)
  * Knowledge of manipulated databases and data structures
  * Domain Knowledge of the Subject
  
#### Day 2
###### Core Concepts in Data Science

* Types of Data:
 + Numeric
 + Catagorical
 + Ordinal  
 + text
 + images
 + videos

### Types of Models
#### Supervised:  
labels are known
* Regression: predict a continuous variable, IE: predict commute time to work
    
    + linear models
    + NNet
    + tree based models
    + Nearest Neighbors
    
  * Classification: predict a category, IE: predict whether a bank will default yes or no
    + Logicistic Regression
    + SVM
    + NNnet
    + trees
    + Nearest Neighbors
    + Rule Based Learners
    
#### Unsupervised
labels are unknown, and natural patterns are used to determine labels
  * Clustering
    + Kmeans
    + Hierarical Clustering
    + Density Based Clustering
  * NNets Autoencoders and Generatoaros
  * Association Learning /  Market Basket Analysis
      + Apriori association learning
      + NNets

##### Homework

Due Next Week's class, grading is pass if completed, else fail.
* Download and the software listed in the README (ie course Sylabus)
* Create a decision tree model to using the built in Iris data set in the data folder to predict iris types.
* upload to oaks a screen shot of the classifier output with the confusion matrix with a hand written text description of how the model works.  (Ensure the model is small enought to actually describe)
